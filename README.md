# Kami o sagasu (紙を探す)

**Kami o sagasu** — Japanese for *“Searching for Paper”* — is an open-source project focused on intelligent document discovery, analysis, and secure knowledge management.

The system scans files from various sources, processes them using **OCR**, **parsing tools**, and **LLMs**, and stores all extracted content in a **full-text searchable database**.  
This enables not only fast keyword search but also **semantic understanding** and **context-aware retrieval** of information.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-source ingestion** – Automatically scans and imports files from multiple sources (local, remote, or API-based).  
- **OCR & AI-driven extraction** – Reads and understands text from scanned images, PDFs, and other documents using modern OCR and LLM models.  
- **Full-text & semantic search** – Powerful search capabilities across all indexed content, including contextual queries.  
- **Secure & closed data environment** – All data stays within a controlled, local environment; no external data leakage.  
- **Scalable architecture** – Designed to handle massive data sets efficiently.  
- **Extensible by design** – Open architecture for custom integrations and AI pipelines.

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **OCR** – Tesseract / PaddleOCR (configurable)  
- **LLM Integration** – LocalAI / Ollama / OpenAI compatible models  
- **Database** – Full-text index via PostgreSQL,Elasticsearch or ChromaDB  
- **Backend** – Node.js / TypeScript with modular service structure  
- **Security** – Encrypted storage and sandboxed AI access

## 🔒 Philosophy

Kami o sagasu aims to bring the power of AI-based document understanding into a **self-hosted, private, and transparent** ecosystem.  
It combines traditional document management with modern AI — without sacrificing privacy or control.

> *“Find paper. Understand meaning.”*
